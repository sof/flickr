= hsflickr - Programming Flickr from Haskell =

'hsflickr' is a Haskell package providing a binding to
the Flickr API - http://www.flickr.com/services/api/

The binding is functionally complete (Nov 2008), letting
you write applications in Haskell that access and manipulates
content on Flickr, either public information or per-user
photos and properties. Including the uploading of new photos.

= Getting started =

For some code samples showing you how to get started using this
API binding, have a look in the examples/ directory. 

= Building and installing =

This package is provided in Cabal form, so only thing you need to
do to get going is:

  foo% runghc Setup configure
  foo% runghc Setup build 
  foo% runghc Setup install

The package depends on a bunch of other packages though, so you
need to have them built&installed, as well. They are:

  * HTTP: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP
  * xml:  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xml
  * mime >= 0.3: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mime
  * utf8-string: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/utf8-string

= Authentication =

To use this API binding to build your own Flickr application, you ought
to apply for your own set of API keys to identify yourself with when
prompting the user. See, http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/ , 
for how to apply -- use either a 'mobile' or 'web' type of key. With
that API key, instantiate your own APIKey value, see Util.Keys for
definition of that type + examples of its use. 

(The keys that come with the package by default are not guaranteed to
stick around for too long, esp. if their use end up being used in inapprop.
ways.)
